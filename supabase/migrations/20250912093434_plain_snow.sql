/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

  1. Security Policy Updates
    - Remove circular dependency in admin profile reading policy
    - Simplify policies to avoid recursion
    - Use auth.jwt() to check user roles instead of querying profiles table

  2. Changes Made
    - Updated admin policies to use JWT claims instead of profile table queries
    - Simplified user policies to use direct auth.uid() comparisons
    - Fixed all policies that were causing infinite recursion
